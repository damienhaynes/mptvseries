=What is MP-TVSeries=

MP-TVSeries is a popular TV Series plug-in for MediaPortal, an open-source media center application. It focuses on managing the user's TV Series library with minimal user interaction, allowing for a more user friendly and ease of use experience.

The MP-TVSeries plugin will scan your hard drive (including network and removable drives) for video files, it then analyzes them by their path structures to determine if they are TV Shows. If the file(s) are recognized then the plugin will go online to thetvdb.com and retrieve information about them. You can then browse, manage and play your episodes from inside MediaPortal in a nice graphical layout.

This Plugin does not play Live TV

=Integration with Social Media Websites =

MP-TVSeries optionally integrates with the [http://follw.it follw.it] and [http://trakt.tv trakt.tv] and [http://myshows.ru myshows.ru] websites, which are built around sharing with your friends what shows and movies you are into.

One of the advantages to connecting to one or all of the sites is the syncronisation of your watch flags and ratings, which we recommend. This is very useful if you have multiple htpcs, or if you need to start your tv series database from scratch.

You can use any or all of the sites at the same time.

==Follw.it==

 * From version 2.8.0+, you can configure follw.it from within the Plugin Configuration for MP-TVSeries

   ===Configuration===

 * Load MP-TVSeries from Mediaportal Configuration, Plugins.

==Trakt.tv==

 * From version 2.8.1+, the Trakt.tv support will be moved to its own process plugin called [http://trakt.tv/downloads/mediaportal Trakt for Mediaportal]. This plugin will be included with the MP-TVSeries installer should you wish to install it or you can download MPEI package at any time.

   ===Installation===
   You can install the Trakt process plugin from the MP-TVSeries installation program, a installation wiki is available [http://code.google.com/p/mptvseries/wiki/Installation?ts=1302228665&updated=Installation# here]. Optionally you can [https://github.com/Technicolour/Trakt-for-Mediaportal/downloads/ download] the TraktPlugin.dll manually and copy it into \Team MediaPortal\MediaPortal\plugins\process

   ===Configuration During Install===

 * Download and run the Latest MP-TVSeries [http://www.team-mediaportal.com/extensions/movies-videos/mp-tvseries installer]
 * During Install, Ensure Trakt Feature is enabled

----

=File Naming Conventions=
MP-TVSeries supports various naming conventions, if you want a perfect match without any user interaction, its best to name the Series as it is shown on thetvdb.com. If the Show contains a : such as CSI: Miami you could use CSI Miami or CSI- Miami

 ==Examples Of Supported Filenames==
Here are a few random examples which will parse.
 * Alias.S01E01.avi
 * Alias - S01E01 - Pilot.avi
 * Alias.1x1.avi
 * Alias - 1x1 - Pilot.avi
 * Alias 01x01.mkv

 ==Series with Specials==
Specials need to be labeled as Season 0, Lets take Top Gear Polar Special for example, Find Top Gear on thetvdb and click on [http://www.thetvdb.com/?tab=season&seriesid=74608&seasonid=22070&lid=7 Specials]. We can see in the Specials list, its labeled as Episode 49, so a filename for that could be
 * Top Gear - S00E49 - Polar Special.avi
 * Top Gear - 0x49.mkv
 
 ==Original Series And Remakes==
If you have a series which has been rebooted, lets take Battlestar Galatica for example, there is the Original, a 1980's version and a 2003 version, How do you name these? go to [http://www.thetvdb.com thetvdb.com], search Battlestar Galatica. We need to name our files the same way. note each series has a different show id comfirming they are all different series
 http://mptvseries.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Images/TvdbBSGExample.jpg

 * Battlestar Galactica  - S01E01.avi  (match as original series)
 * Battlestar Galactica (1980) - S01E01.avi  (match as 1980's series)
 * Battlestar Galactica (2003) - S01E01.avi  (match as 2003 series)

If a series was already imported incorrectly in Mediaportal, highlight the series, press F9 or Info on remote, then press 'Force new online lookup for series'.
This will prompt you to select a series or manually enter a search term.

 ==Mini-Series==
A standalone Mini Series, like Dune, will usually have the part 1, part 2 etc listed at Season 1, Episode 1, Episode 2 etc on thetvdb. If for example, the Mini Series lead to a TV Show, such as BattleStar Galactica (2003) that Mini Series may be listed in Specials / Season 0. 

The Solution is to check the Mini-Series on [http://thetvdb.com thetvdb.com], match your files names to their syntax. Examples:

 * Frank Herbert's Dune - S01E01.avi
 * Frank Herbert's Dune - S01E02.avi
 * Frank Herbert's Dune - S01E03.avi
 * Battlestar Galactica (2003) - S00E01 - MiniSeries(1).avi
 * Battlestar Galactica (2003) - S00E02 - MiniSeries(2).avi

 ==Single File - Double Episode==
MP-TVSeries can support 2 episodes in a single file. More than 2 is not currently supported

See examples below

 * Alias.1x01.1x02.avi
 * Alias S01E01-E02.avi 
 * Alias S01E01 + S01E02.avi
 * Alias - s01e01 - s01e02.mkv
 * Alias #1.01 + #1.02.avi

If you start playback on 1x01 from "Alias - S01E01-E02.avi", then both episodes will be played, the end result is both episode 1 and 2 will be marked as watched. You can still start playback on 1x02, but it will start at the beginning of the file (but this is what one would expect anyway). If you start 1x01, but stop at the halfway point where 1x02 begins, then both 1x01+02 show as unwatched and when you try to restart playback you will get the "resume from" dialog

 ==Single Episode - Multiple Files==
MP-TVSeries is does not currently support combining multiple files into a single episode, It will show those files as duplicates in the episode list

We recommend in this scenario to join the files together, Click the following links for example programs for [http://www.alexander-noe.com/video/amg/ AVI files] and [http://www.bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/ MKV files]

 ==Episodes with Air Date==
MP-TVSeries now supports AirDate parsing, matched up from episodes listed at theTVDB.com
Some examples below are episodes which will now parse by default - Note: requires atleast v2.9.3 for MP 1.1 or v3.0.5 for MP 1.2B

 * Conan.(2010).2010.11.08.Baa.Baa.Blackmail.mkv 
 * Conan.(2010).2011.07.20.Hell.Hath.No.Cell.Phone.Reception.mkv
 * The.Colbert.Report.2011.07.27.Dr.Missy.Cummings.mkv

 ==Auto Renaming of Files==
MP-TVSeries does not currently support the auto renaming of your files. However their are free 3rd party tools such as [http://www.theRenamer.com TheRenamer], [http://www.tvrename.com Tv Rename], [http://www.mediacentermaster.com/ Media Centre Master ] and [http://filebot.sourceforge.net/ Filebot] which you could use to organise/rename the files in your collection.

 ==Folder Structure==
There are many variations you could use, below is a way that works well with the renaming tools above. 
 * TV  --> Series Name  --> Season # ---> 30 Rock - S01E01 - Pilot.avi
 http://mptvseries.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Images/FolderStructureExample.jpg


----

=Episode Ordering - Online Matching=
MP-TVSeries has options to change the episode ordering for a series, you will only see options available if its applicable to that series

 ==Air Date=
 This is the default option, shows will be ordered by the date they were aired

 ==DVD Order==
 Choose this option to have your episodes listed in the order they were released on DVD, DVD ordering if often used to correct minor, sometimes major changes in episode ordering that was initially aired on TV

 ==Title==
 This matches episode by title.  Example. firefly - 1x01 - Serenity.mkv In this case will be parsed as 'Serenity' and will attempt to find an online match with episodes that have that title.
 This may be useful for specials which keep on getting re-ordered online.

 ==Absolute Order==
 This option can only be selected on a Series, not a Season. Some series, like Anime may not be broken in Seasons. In order to accommodate this Absolute Order can be used

 ==Changing Matching Method==
 You can initially select these options on your [http://code.google.com/p/mptvseries/wiki/GettingStarted?ts=1301693772&updated=GettingStarted#Initial_Configuration inital import],or you can change it inside Mediaportal
 * In Mediaportal - Select the Series or Season
 * Press F9 on keyboard or INFO on MCE Remote
 * Choose ACTIONS
 * Choose CHANGE ONLINE MATCHING METHOD

----

=Download Episode Information for Whole Series==
To download all the available information for your Series, including Episodes you may not have, Episodes that have not aired yet, and display these episodes inside Mediaportal, do either or the following to enable. note: all episode info will be downloaded next import run.

 ==Option 1: Enable in Configuration==
 * Load MP-TVSeries Plugin Configuration
 * OnlineData Tab
 * Check the box _'Download Episode Information for the whole Series'_
 * The next import may take a while as it downloads all the available information for all your imported Series
 http://mptvseries.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Images/DownloadEpisodeInfoAll.jpg

 ==Option 2: Enable in Mediaportal==
 * in Mediaporal, MP-TVSeries Plugin
 * Press F9 on keyboard or INFO on MCE Remote
 * Click OPTIONS
 * Change 'DOWNLOAD ALL EPISODE INFO' to ON

 ==Show / Hide==
 * in Mediaporal, MP-TVSeries Plugin
 * Press F9 on keyboard or INFO on MCE Remote
 * Click OPTIONS
 * Change 'SHOW ALL EPISODES' to ON
 
 You will now see all episodes for a Series, Depending on Skin, those episodes may show in a different colour, e.g. Orange in Blue3Wide & StreamedMP. If a Season only shows a partial amount of all the expected episodes, then those episodes havent been added yet on thetvdb.com. 

----
=Importing=

 ==Imported Episode Image is Incorrect==
 If you find a episode which has a incorrect episode image, it may be been incorrectly uploaded at thetvdb. When the image is replaced with a correct version, MP-TVSeries will not automatically download this, however you can do this manually

 Note: MP-TVSeries v2.7+ will show a FanArt episode image if there is no episode image available, which will be updated automatically, and not to be confused with an Incorrect Episode Image

 * In Mediaportal, Select the Episode
 * Press F9 on keyboard, or INFO on MCE remote
 * Click ACTIONS
 * Click UPDATE

 ==Importing Videos Not At TheTVDB==
 MP-TVSeries is not intended for this scenario, but there is a solution you can use. If you have videos that you want to show in MP-TVSeries, and its not appropriate to create it at thetvdb.com, such as personal movies recorded on video cameras etc, you can try the following - Recommend MP-TVSeries v2.9+

 * Create proper filenames with season and episode syntax e.g.
   * My Trip to Fiji - S01E01.avi
   * My Trip to Fiji - S01E02.avi
   * My Trip to Fiji - S01E03.avi
   * My Trip to Fiji - S01E04.avi

 * Load Media Portal Configuration, MP-TVSeries plugin.
 * Start the Import Wizard, and select Skip when no match is found for the 'My Trip to Fiji'
 * Finish Import
 * Select 'Details' tab.
 * Find your Series, Enter Series and Episode info (This will create USEREDIT fields in database)
 * Right Click on series and select 'Ignore on Scan' so we dont prompt to match series everytime an import is run.
 * Enter GUI and select series, then play!

 By default MP-TVSeries will automatically generate episode titles if they dont exist online e.g Episode 1, Episode 2 etc. If this behaviour is not wanted you can manually edit the Options Table in the database and set *AutoGenerateEpisodeTitles* to Zero. This change will only take affect for *NEW* episodes added to database, if you want to respect episode titles from filenames for existing files that have been import then you need to clear the database and re-import.

----

=Custom Artwork=
Typically if you are importing videos not available on theTVDB.com such as sports videos, then you will most likely want to add some artwork. Follow these instructions to get custom artwork in tvseries:

 * In your thumbs\MPTVSeriesBanners\ folder create the *Show Name* if it doesnt already exist (this should match your series name, replace invalid filename characters with underscore) and then create the following directory structure:
  http://mptvseries.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Images/FAQ/CustomArtworkExplorerFolderStructure.jpg
 * In the *episode* folder create artwork in the following format: custom-{seasonindex}x{episodeindex}.jpg e.g. *custom-2001x1.jpg*
 * In the *season* folder create artwork in the following format: custom-{seasonindex}.jpg e.g *custom-2011.jpg*
 * In the *widebanner* and *poster* folders create artwork in the following format: *custom.jpg*
 * For *fanart*, you must first find the *Online Series ID* which is located in the configuration details tab for the selected series. This is typically a negative number e.g. *-70*. Now simply drop a fanart file into your fanart directory e.g. *thumbs\Fan Art\fanart\original\-70.jpg*

Now in Configuration, select the series and pick the *custom* artwork from the drop down list.

----

=Multiple HTPCs and MP-TVSeries=

Mediaportal 1 does not have native support for sharing its databases across multiple clients, this is something scheduled for Mediaportal 2. There are options, the first, is the [http://wiki.team-mediaportal.com/UserGuides/CentralisedDatabases multi-seat] Approach (not recommended/supported). The Second option, is below

 ==Main HTPC==

 * Make sure all paths are using UNC paths, no local paths, mapped drives are not recommended
 * Configure your first HTPC with all the options/settings you prefer
 * Check your main HTPC is synced follw.it and or trakt
 * Run a Full Import
 * Close Mediaportal

 ==Additional HTPCs==

 Its recommeded to have the same version of the MP-TVSeries plugin as your Main HTPC

 * Close Mediaporal
 * From the main HTPC, copy its [http://code.google.com/p/mptvseries/wiki/FAQ#TVSeriesDatabase4.db3 TVSeriesDatabase4.db3] to your additional HTPCs, overwriting.
 * From the main HTPC, copy its [http://code.google.com/p/mptvseries/wiki/FAQ#MPTVSeriesBanners_and_Fan_Art_(Folders) MPTVSeriesBanners and Fan Art (Folders)] to your additional HTPCs, overwriting. Note you could just copy the entire thumbs folder (recommend), especially if you are doing the same process with MovingPictures etc.
 * Open Mediaportal and you should have a working MP-TVSeries. When a show is watched on 1 HTPC it will be replicated to the others when it next syncs with Follw.it or Trakt.tv

  ===Advantages===
  * You can use all HTPCs at the same time
  * No greater risk of Database Corruption

  ===Disadvantages===
  * Every new episode added after you copied the database/thumbs will be imported on every additional HTPC, so this will use additional internet traffic
  * Changes you make on one HTPC, e.g. disabling fanart, changing views, adding/removing favourites are not replicated to the other HTPCs. (Until you copy the database again)

----

=Language Support=
MP-TVSeries supports multiple languages, and you are welcome to contribute by updating or adding a new language.

 ==Configuration==
 * Lauch the MP-TVSeries Plugin Configuration
 * Click _General_ Tab
 * Drop down the Language box, choose your language
 * Close MediaPortal

 ==Update Language==
 If you find a language has incorrect spelling, or missing some translation fields, you can update the appropriate .xml file in the [http://code.google.com/p/mptvseries/wiki/FAQ#Language.XML_(Files) Language Folder]. Please submit the updated file on the [http://forum.team-mediaportal.com/my-tvseries-162/ forum]

 ==Add New Language==
 * Download the latest English XML [http://mptvseries.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/MP-TVSeries/Resources/Languages/en(us).xml here]
 * Rename en(us).xml to yourlanguage.xml

 * Submit the new xml to the [http://forum.team-mediaportal.com/my-tvseries-162/ forum] to be included in an upcoming build

----

=Edit Database=

 If you need to edit the MP-TVSeries database directly,you can download a SQLite tool, such as [http://sqlitebrowser.sourceforge.net/development.html sqlitebrowser] and open the [http://code.google.com/p/mptvseries/wiki/FAQ#TVSeriesDatabase4.db3 TVSeriesDatabase4.db3] file.
 
 http://mptvseries.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Images/SQLiteOpen.jpg

----
=Database Corruption=
Its sometimes reported that the database file TVSeriesDatabase4.db3 has become damaged in some fashion. The MP-TVSeries plugin in Mediaportal may not function correctly, such as your Series/Episodes are missing etc.

 ==Identify Corruption==
 The MP-TVSeries.log file will usually contain multiple events like the following:
 * Commit failed on this command:
 * SQLiteClient:  cmd:sqlite3_finalize err:CORRUPT detailed:database disk image is malformed query

 ==Causes==
 * If you are using Mediaportal/MP-TVSeries in (unsupported and not recommended) [http://wiki.team-mediaportal.com/UserGuides/CentralisedDatabases multi-seat mode], this will likely lead to database corruption if multiple clients write to the database at the same time
 * Hard Shutdown of PC while MP-TVSeries is preforming a database operation, (i.e Power Loss)
 * PC Crash / Lockup / BSOD
 * Your just unlucky!

 ==Solution==
 There are 2 options, restore from a backup file, start a new database. Note: Artwork that has already been downloaded will be automatically re-used and not re-downloaded

  ===Option 1 - Restore from Backup File===
  If you installed MP-TVSeries from the installer, it would have made a backup database in the below directory location. You could take the backup file from this location and overwrite the corrupt [http://code.google.com/p/mptvseries/wiki/FAQ#TVSeriesDatabase4.db3 TVSeriesDatabase4.db3]. If the backups are extremely old, it may be wiser to use Option 2

|| XP || C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Team MediaPortal\MediaPortal\database\TVSeries_Backup\ ||
|| Vista & Win7 || C:\ProgramData\Team MediaPortal\MediaPortal\database\TVSeries_Backup\ ||


  ===Option 2 - New Database===

  }}}

 ==Speed Up Import - Ignore Old Series==
   If you have a large collection and notice it takes a while for the import process to run, you could tell MP-TVSeries to ignore some of your collection. You should only do this on old shows that are well and truley finished and are unlikely to be edited/changed at the tvdb.com
