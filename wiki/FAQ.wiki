=Integration with Social Media Websites =

MP-TVSeries optionally integrates with the [http://follw.it follw.it] and [http://trakt.tv trakt.tv] websites, which are built around sharing with your friends what shows and movies you are into.

One of the advantages to connecting to one or both of the sites is the syncronisation of your watch flags and ratings, which we recommend. This is very useful if you have multiple htpcs, or if you need to start your tv series database from scratch.

You can use either or both of the sites at the same time.

==Follw.it==

 * From version 2.8.0+, you can configure follw.it from within the Plugin Configuration for MP-TVSeries

   ===Configuration===

 * Load MP-TVSeries from Mediaportal Configuration, Plugins.
 * Click _Follw.it Tab_
 * Click _Setup Account_
 * Follow the OnScreen instructions
 http://mptvseries.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Images/FollwitConfig.jpg
   

==Trakt.tv==

 * From version 2.8.1+, the Trakt.tv support will be moved to its own process plugin called [http://forum.team-mediaportal.com/mediaportal-plugins-47/0-9-3-0-trakt-mediaportal-94872/ Trakt for Mediaportal]. This plugin will be included with the MP-TVSeries installer should you wish to install it.

   ===Installation===
   You can install the Trakt process plugin from the MP-TVSeries installation program, a installation wiki is available [http://code.google.com/p/mptvseries/wiki/Installation?ts=1302228665&updated=Installation# here]. Optionally you can download the TraktPlugin.dll manually and copy it into \Team MediaPortal\MediaPortal\plugins\process

   ===Configuration During Install===

 * Download and run the Latest MP-TVSeries [http://code.google.com/p/mptvseries/downloads/list installer]
 * During Install, Ensure Trakt Feature is enabled
 * Type in your trakt.tv username and password into the password box
 * Check the box for MP-TVSeries and any optional plugin
 * Click Next
 http://mptvseries.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Images/SetupTrakt.jpg


   ===Configuration After Install===

 * Load Mediaportal Configuration, Plugins.
 * Load _Trakt_ which is under 'Process Plugins'
 * Type in your trakt.tv username and password
 * Check the box for MP-TVSeries
 * Click OK
 http://mptvseries.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Images/TraktConfig.jpg

----

=File Naming Conventions=
MP-TVSeries supports various naming conventions, if you want a perfect match without any user interaction, its best to name the Series as it is shown on thetvdb.com. If the Show contains a : such as CSI: Miami you could use CSI Miami or CSI- Miami

 ==Examples Of Supported Filenames==
Here are a few random examples which will parse.
 * Alias.S01E01.avi
 * Alias - S01E01 - Pilot.avi
 * Alias.1x1.avi
 * Alias - 1x1 - Pilot.avi
 * Alias 01x01.mkv

 ==Series with Specials==
Specials need to be labeled as Season 0, Lets take Top Gear Polar Special for example, Find Top Gear on thetvdb and click on [http://www.thetvdb.com/?tab=season&seriesid=74608&seasonid=22070&lid=7 Specials]. We can see in the Specials list, its labeled as Episode 49, so a filename for that could be
 * Top Gear - S00E49 - Polar Special.avi
 * Top Gear - 0x49.mkv
 
 ==Original Series And Remakes==
If you have a series which has been rebooted, lets take Battlestar Galatica for example, there is the Original, a 1980's version and a 2003 version, How do you name these? go to [http://www.thetvdb.com thetvdb.com], search Battlestar Galatica. We need to name our files the same way. note each series has a different show id comfirming they are all different series
 http://mptvseries.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Images/TvdbBSGExample.jpg

 * Battlestar Galactica  - S01E01.avi  (match as original series)
 * Battlestar Galactica (1980) - S01E01.avi  (match as 1980's series)
 * Battlestar Galactica (2003) - S01E01.avi  (match as 2003 series)

If a series was already imported incorrectly in Mediaportal, highlight the series, press F9 or Info on remote, then press 'Force new online lookup for series'.
This will prompt you to select a series or manually enter a search term.

 ==Mini-Series==
A standalone Mini Series, like Dune, will usually have the part 1, part 2 etc listed at Season 1, Episode 1, Episode 2 etc on thetvdb. If for example, the Mini Series lead to a TV Show, such as BattleStar Galactica (2003) that Mini Series may be listed in Specials / Season 0. 

The Solution is to check the Mini-Series on [http://thetvdb.com thetvdb.com], match your files names to their syntax. Examples:

 * Frank Herbert's Dune - S01E01.avi
 * Frank Herbert's Dune - S01E02.avi
 * Frank Herbert's Dune - S01E03.avi
 * Battlestar Galactica (2003) - S00E01 - MiniSeries(1).avi
 * Battlestar Galactica (2003) - S00E02 - MiniSeries(2).avi

 ==Single File - Double Episode==
MP-TVSeries can support 2 episodes in a single file. More than 2 is not currently supported

See examples below

 * Alias.1x01.1x02.avi
 * Alias S01E01-E02.avi 
 * Alias S01E01 + S01E02.avi
 * Alias - s01e01 - s01e02.mkv
 * Alias #1.01 + #1.02.avi

If you start playback on 1x01 from "Alias - S01E01-E02.avi", then both episodes will be played, the end result is both episode 1 and 2 will be marked as watched. You can still start playback on 1x02, but it will start at the beginning of the file (but this is what one would expect anyway). If you start 1x01, but stop at the halfway point where 1x02 begins, then both 1x01+02 show as unwatched and when you try to restart playback you will get the "resume from" dialog

 ==Single Episode - Multiple Files==
MP-TVSeries is does not currently support combining multiple files into a single episode, It will show those files as duplicates in the episode list

We recommend in this scenario to join the files together, Click the following links for example programs for [http://www.alexander-noe.com/video/amg/ AVI files] and [http://www.bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/ MKV files]

 ==Episodes with Air Date==
MP-TVSeries does not currently support filenames that only contain the Air Date, example 'The Daily Show with Jon Stewart - 2010-12-16.avi'
There is a open enhancement request [http://code.google.com/p/mptvseries/issues/detail?id=127 here], which you may like to Star.

 ==Auto Renaming of Files==
MP-TVSeries does not currently support the auto renaming of your files. However their are free 3rd party tools such as [http://www.theRenamer.com TheRenamer] and [http://www.tvrename.com Tv Rename] 

 ==Folder Structure==
There are many variations you could use, below is a way that works well with the renaming tools above. 
 * TV  --> Series Name  --> Season # ---> 30 Rock - S01E01 - Pilot.avi
 http://mptvseries.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Images/FolderStructureExample.jpg


----

=Episode Ordering - Online Matching=
MP-TVSeries has options to change the episode ordering for a series, you will only see options available if its applicable to that series

 ==Air Date=
 This is the default option, shows will be ordered by the date they were aired

 ==DVD Order==
 Choose this option to have your episodes listed in the order they were released on DVD, DVD ordering if often used to correct minor, sometimes major changes in episode ordering that was initially aired on TV

 ==Title==
 This matches episode by title.  Example. firefly - 1x01 - Serenity.mkv In this case will be parsed as 'Serenity' and will attempt to find an online match with episodes that have that title.
 This may be useful for specials which keep on getting re-ordered online.

 ==Absolute Order==
 This option can only be selected on a Series, not a Season. Some series, like Anime may not be broken in Seasons. In order to accommodate this Absolute Order can be used

 ==Changing Matching Method==
 You can initially select these options on your [http://code.google.com/p/mptvseries/wiki/GettingStarted?ts=1301693772&updated=GettingStarted#Initial_Configuration inital import],or you can change it inside Mediaportal

----
=Importing=

 ==Imported Episode Image is Incorrect==
 If you find a episode which has a incorrect episode image, it may be been incorrectly uploaded at thetvdb. When the image is replaced with a correct version, MP-TVSeries will not automatically download this, however you can do this manually

 ==Importing Videos Not At TheTVDB==
 MP-TVSeries is not intended for this scenario, but there is a solution you can use.

 * Create proper filenames with season and episode syntax e.g.
   * My Trip to Fiji - S01E01.avi
   * My Trip to Fiji - S01E02.avi
   * My Trip to Fiji - S01E03.avi
   * My Trip to Fiji - S01E04.avi

----

=Backup and Migration=

If you want to backup your MP-TVSeries data, or migrate it to a new computer you need to backup/restore the following.

 * Backup [http://code.google.com/p/mptvseries/wiki/FAQ#TVSeriesDatabase4.db3 TVSeriesDatabase4.db3]
 * Backup [http://code.google.com/p/mptvseries/wiki/FAQ#MPTVSeriesBanners_and_Fan_Art_(Folders) MPTVSeriesBanners and Fan Art (Folders)]. Note you could just copy the entire 'thumbs' folder (recommend), especially if you have ClearART etc are doing the same process with MovingPictures.


----

=Multiple HTPCs and MP-TVSeries=

Mediaportal 1 does not have native support for sharing its databases across multiple clients, this is something scheduled for Mediaportal 2. There are options, the first, is the [http://wiki.team-mediaportal.com/UserGuides/CentralisedDatabases multi-seat] Approach (not recommended/supported). The Second option, is below

 ==Main HTPC==

 * Make sure all paths are using UNC paths, no local paths, mapped drives are not recommended
 * Configure your first HTPC with all the options/settings you prefer
 * Check your main HTPC is synced follw.it and or trakt
 * Run a Full Import
 * Close Mediaportal

 ==Additional HTPCs==

 Its recommeded to have the same version of the MP-TVSeries plugin as your Main HTPC

 * Close Mediaporal
 * From the main HTPC, copy its [http://code.google.com/p/mptvseries/wiki/FAQ#TVSeriesDatabase4.db3 TVSeriesDatabase4.db3] to your additional HTPCs, overwriting.
 * From the main HTPC, copy its [http://code.google.com/p/mptvseries/wiki/FAQ#MPTVSeriesBanners_and_Fan_Art_(Folders) MPTVSeriesBanners and Fan Art (Folders)] to your additional HTPCs, overwriting. Note you could just copy the entire thumbs folder (recommend), especially if you are doing the same process with MovingPictures etc.
 * Open Mediaportal and you should have a working MP-TVSeries. When a show is watched on 1 HTPC it will be replicated to the others when it next syncs with Follw.it or Trakt.tv

  ===Advantages===
  * You can use all HTPCs at the same time
  * No greater risk of Database Corruption

  ===Disadvantages===
  * Every new episode added after you copied the database/thumbs will be imported on every additional HTPC, so this will use additional internet traffic
  * Changes you make on one HTPC, e.g. disabling fanart, changing views, adding/removing favourites are not replicated to the other HTPCs. (Until you copy the database again)

----

=Language Support=
MP-TVSeries supports multiple languages, and you are welcome to contribute by updating or adding a new language.

 ==Configuration==
 * Lauch the MP-TVSeries Plugin Configuration
 * Click _General_ Tab
 * Drop down the Language box, choose your language

 http://mptvseries.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Images/SQLiteOpen.jpg

----
=Database Corruption=
Its sometimes reported that the database file TVSeriesDatabase4.db3 has become damaged in some fashion. The MP-TVSeries plugin in Mediaportal may not function correctly, such as your Series/Episodes are missing etc.

 ==Identify Corruption==
 The MP-TVSeries.log file will usually contain multiple events like the following:
 * Commit failed on this command:
 * SQLiteClient:  cmd:sqlite3_finalize err:CORRUPT detailed:database disk image is malformed query

 ==Causes==
 * If you are using Mediaportal/MP-TVSeries in (unsupported and not recommended) [http://wiki.team-mediaportal.com/UserGuides/CentralisedDatabases multi-seat mode], this will likely lead to database corruption if multiple clients write to the database at the same time
 * Hard Shutdown of PC while MP-TVSeries is preforming a database operation, (i.e Power Loss)
 * PC Crash / Lockup / BSOD
 * Your just unlucky!

 ==Solution==
 There are 2 options, restore from a backup file, start a new database. Note: Artwork that has already been downloaded will be automatically re-used and not re-downloaded

  ===Option 1 - Restore from Backup File===
  If you installed MP-TVSeries from the installer, it would have made a backup database in the below directory location. You could take the backup file from this location and overwrite the corrupt [http://code.google.com/p/mptvseries/wiki/FAQ#TVSeriesDatabase4.db3 TVSeriesDatabase4.db3]. If the backups are extremely old, it may be wiser to use Option 2

  * *XP*  C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Team MediaPortal\MediaPortal\database\TVSeries_Backup\
  * *Vista & Windows 7*  C:\ProgramData\Team MediaPortal\MediaPortal\database\TVSeries_Backup\


  ===Option 2 - New Database===

  * Delete your database file [http://code.google.com/p/mptvseries/wiki/FAQ?ts=1301645826&updated=FAQ#TVSeriesDatabase4.db3 TVSeriesDatabase4.db3]  
  * TVSeriesDatabase4.db3 will be re-created next time mediportal or the MP-TVSeries plugin configuration executes
  * Reimport your shows
  * (Optional) _Import Watched Flags_ after import is complete, or resetup your [http://code.google.com/p/mptvseries/wiki/FAQ#Follw.it follw.it] or [http://code.google.com/p/mptvseries/wiki/FAQ#Trakt.tv trakt.tv] account.

   * You can further tweak this by changing the Short Date syntax settings in Control Panel, Regional settings. 

 ==Use "String Replacements" To Resolve Weird filenames==
   You might have made a typo in the filenames, are using cryptic/acronym based filenames or using a different language then what thetvdb.com uses to identify the TV Show. Instead of renaming a lot of files, you can simply use the 'String Replacements' system to fix these problems. You can find this in the 'Import' tab in MP-TVSeries plugin configuration

  * Latest Aired Unwatched  
  {{{
  episode<;><Episode.FirstAired>;<=;<today><cond><Episode.FirstAired>;>=;<today-30><cond><Episode.Watched>;=;0<;><Episode.FirstAired>;desc<;>
  }}}

  * Recently Added UnWatched 
  {{{
  episode<;><Episode.FileDateCreated>;>=;<today-7><cond><Episode.Watched>;=;0<;><Episode.FileDateCreated>;desc<;>
  }}}

 ==Speed Up Import - Ignore Old Series==
   If you have a large collection and notice it takes a while for the import process to run, you could tell MP-TVSeries to ignore some of your collection. You should only do this on old shows that are well and truley finished and are unlikely to be edited/changed at the tvdb.com
   * Load MP-TVSeries plugin Configuration
   * Click on the 'Details' Tab
   * Right Click an Old Series
   * Select 'Ignore on Scan'

 ==Speed Up Import - Upgrade to MP-TVSeries 2.9+==
   MP-TVSeries 2.9+ has significantly faster import times compared to MP-TVSeries 2.8 and below due to a new [http://code.google.com/p/mptvseries/wiki/FAQ#Series_Cache_%28Files%29 Caching] feature. If you have a large collection, this is highly recommended.

 ==Speed Up Series Browsing - Change Layout==
   In Mediaportal, if you find browsing the Series list is slow or not smooth when scrolling, you may have older HTPC hardware for example, try switching the Series layouts to 'LIST POSTERS' or 'LIST BANNERS'
   * In Mediportal, go into MP-TVSeries and browse your entire Series.
   * Press F9 or INFO on MCE Remote
