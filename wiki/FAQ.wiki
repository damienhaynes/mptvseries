=Integration with Social Media Websites =

MP-TVSeries optionally integrates with the [http://follw.it follw.it] and [http://trakt.tv trakt.tv] websites, which are built around sharing with your friends what shows and movies you are into.

One of the advantages to connecting to one or both of the sites is the syncronisation of your watch flags and ratings. This is useful if you have multiple htpcs, or if you need to start your tv series database from scratch.

You can use either or both of the sites at the same time.

==Follw.it==

 * From version 2.8.0+, you can configure follw.it from within the Plugin Configuration for MP-TVSeries

   ===Configuration===

 * Load MP-TVSeries from Mediaportal Configuration, Plugins.
 * Click _Follw.it Tab_
 * Click _Setup Account_
 * Follow the OnScreen instructions

==Trakt.tv==

 * From version 2.8.1+, the Trakt.tv supprt will be moved to its own process plugin called [http://forum.team-mediaportal.com/mediaportal-plugins-47/0-9-2-0-trakt-mediaportal-94872/ Trakt for Mediaportal]. This plugin will be included with the MP-TVSeries installer should you wish to install it.


   ===Configuration===

 * Load Mediaportal Configuration, Plugins.
 * Load _Trakt_ which is under 'Process Plugins'
 * Type in your trakt.tv username and password
 * Check the box for MP-TVSeries
 * Click OK

=File Naming Conventions=
MP-TVSeries supports various naming conventions, if you want a perfect match without any user interaction, its best to name the Series as it is shown on thetvdb.com. If the Show contains a : such as CSI: Miami you could use CSI Miami or CSI- Miami

 ==Examples of Supported Filenames==
Here are a few random examples which will parse.
 * Alias.S01E01.avi
 * Alias - S01E01 - Pilot.avi
 * Alias.1x1.avi
 * Alias - 1x1 - Pilot.avi
 * Alias 01x01.mkv

 ==Series with Specials==
Specials need to be labeled as Season 0, Lets take Top Gear Polar Special for example, Find Top Gear on thetvdb and click on [http://www.thetvdb.com/?tab=season&seriesid=74608&seasonid=22070&lid=7 Specials]. We can see in the Specials list, its labeled as Episode 49, so a filename for that could be
 * Top Gear - S00E49 - Polar Special.avi
 * Top Gear - 0x49.mkv
 
 ==Original Series and Remakes==
If you have a series which has been rebooted, lets take Battlestar Galatica for example, there is the Original, a 1980's version and a 2003 version, How do you name these? go to [http://www.thetvdb.com thetvdb.com], search Battlestar Galatica. We need to name our files the same way. note each series has a different show id comfirming they are all different series
 http://mptvseries.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Images/TvdbBSGExample.jpg

 * Battlestar Galactica  - S01E01.avi  this will match as the original series
 * Battlestar Galactica (1980) - S01E01.avi  this will match as the 1980's Series
 * Battlestar Galactica (2003) - S01E01.avi  this will match as the 2003 version.

If a series was already imported incorrectly in Mediaportal, press F9 or Info on remote, then press 'Force new online lookup for series'.
This will prompt you to select a series or manually enter a search term.

 ==Single File - Double Episode==
MP-TVSeries can support 2 episodes in a single file. More than 2 is currently not supported

See examples below

 * Alias.1x01.1x02.avi
 * Alias S01E01-E02.avi 
 * Alias S01E01 + S01E02.avi
 * Alias - s01e01 - s01e02 - bar
 * Alias #1.01 + #1.02.avi

If you start playback on 1x01 from "Alias - S01E01-E02.avi", then both episodes will be played, and the end result is that 1x01 and 1x02 will be marked as watched. You can still start playback on 1x02, but it will start at the beginning of the file (but this is what one would expect anyway). If you start 1x01, but stop at the halfway point where 1x02 begins, then both 1x01+02 show as unwatched and when you try to restart playback you will get the "resume from" dialog

 ==Single Episode over Multiple Files==
MP-TVSeries is not currently able to combine multiple files into 1 episode, It will show those files as duplicates in the episode list

We recommend in this scenario to join the files together, Click the following links for example programs for [http://www.alexander-noe.com/video/amg/ AVI files] and [http://www.bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/ MKV files]

 ==Episodes with Air Date==
MP-TVSeries does not currently support filenames that only contain the Air Date, example 'The Daily Show with Jon Stewart - 2010-12-16.avi'
There is a open enhancement request [http://code.google.com/p/mptvseries/issues/detail?id=127 here], which you may like to Star.

 ==Auto Renaming of Files==
MP-TVSeries does not currently support the auto renaming of your files. However their are free 3rd party tools such as [http://www.theRenamer.com TheRenamer] and [http://www.tvrename.com Tv Rename] 

 ==Folder Structure==
There are many variations you could use, below is a way that works well with the renaming tools above. 
 * TV  --> Series Name  --> Season # ---> Alias 1x1.avi
