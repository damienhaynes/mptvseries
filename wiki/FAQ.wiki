=Integration with Social Media Websites =

MP-TVSeries optionally integrates with the [http://follw.it follw.it] and [http://trakt.tv trakt.tv] websites, which are built around sharing with your friends what shows and movies you are into.

One of the advantages to connecting to one or both of the sites is the syncronisation of your watch flags and ratings. This is useful if you have multiple htpcs, or if you need to start your tv series database from scratch.

You can use either or both of the sites at the same time.

==Follw.it==

 * From version 2.8.0+, you can configure follw.it from within the Plugin Configuration for MP-TVSeries

   ===Configuration===

 * Load MP-TVSeries from Mediaportal Configuration, Plugins.
 * Click _Follw.it Tab_
 * Click _Setup Account_
 * Follow the OnScreen instructions

=File Naming Conventions=
MP-TVSeries supports various naming conventions, if you want a perfect match without any user interaction, its best to name the Series as it is shown on thetvdb.com. If the Show contains a : such as CSI: Miami you could use CSI Miami or CSI- Miami

 ==Examples of Supported Filenames==
Here are a few random examples which will parse.
 * Alias.S01E01.avi
 * Alias - S01E01 - Pilot.avi
 * Alias.1x1.avi
 * Alias - 1x1 - Pilot.avi
 * Alias 01x01.mkv

 ==Series with Specials==
Specials need to be labeled as Season 0, Lets take Top Gear Polar Special for example, Find Top Gear on thetvdb and click on [http://www.thetvdb.com/?tab=season&seriesid=74608&seasonid=22070&lid=7 Specials]. We can see in the Specials list, its labeled as Episode 49, so a filename for that could be
 * Top Gear - S00E49 - Polar Special

 ==Auto Renaming of Files==
MP-TVSeries does not currently support the auto renaming of your files. However their are free 3rd party tools such as [http://www.theRenamer.com TheRenamer] and [http://www.tvrename.com Tv Rename] 

 ==Folder Structure==
There are many variations you could use, below is a way that works well with the renaming tools above. 
 * TV  --> Series Name  --> Season # ---> Alias 1x1.avi
