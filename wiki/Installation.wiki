By default !MediaPortal plugins and skins are installed to the Program Files folder and will need elevated permissions for installation. Here are some tips for !MediaPortal and the TVSeries plugin to work as expected in Windows Vista (or other UAC enabled operating systems):

  * Disable UAC (User Account Control), by default Vista has UAC enabled. You can disable UAC from the Control Panel in User Accounts:

 * Reboot PC
If you prefer to keep UAC enabled you will need to ensure that the following directories have Full Write access for the logged in User:
  * C:\Program Files\Team !MediaPortal\!MediaPortal
  * C:\ProgramData\Team !MediaPortal\!MediaPortal
If you have previously used !MediaPortal and/or the plugin with UAC enabled, delete the following folders:
  * C:\Users\_username_\AppData\Local\VirtualStore\Program Files\Team !MediaPortal
  * C:\Users\_username_\AppData\Local\VirtualStore\ProgramData\Team !MediaPortal
where _username_ is your currently logged in username.
