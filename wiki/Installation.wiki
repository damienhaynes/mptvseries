Repair should be used when MP-TVSeries is not working due to missing files. This can be caused by files that have been deleted or corrupted accidentally. Repair makes sure files and registry settings are copied and set correctly again. However, it does not allow you select or change features of the install. It will use the default setup settings initially and may reset installation parameters, a Modify should be run afterwards to re-configure the plugin.

== Uninstall ==
When you select the Remove option, the setup wizard will prompt to confirm that you want to un-install:
