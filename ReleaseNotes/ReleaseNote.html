		<p><strong>The views system has been upgraded to support several new features:</strong></p>
		
		<p>The user can now create tagged views, this allows you to add any series to a defined view e.g.
			Documentaries, Kids Shows, Adults Shows etc...
		</p>
		<p>Tagged Views can be created when adding a series to a <b>new</b> view from the plugins context menu with-in
			MediaPortal or from the Views tab in Configuration. The Configuration program allows you to quickly
			multi-select a range of Series to add to a particular view using the Add/Edit view dialog.
		</p>
		<p>Several new Built-in views have been added, some of which include: Actors, Adult Series, Kids Series,
			Continuing Series, Ended Series, Top 10 etc. These views are available for selection in the Views
			Configuration using the <b>Templates</b> dialog.

			locked down your views, enter a 4-Digit Pin in the Pin Code dialog. When a protected view is selected
			from the plugin in MediaPortal you will be prompted to insert your Pin Code, if the pin entered is
			correct you will see the contents of the protected view. If you have correctly entered a pin code and
			then re-enter the view you will not be prompted unless you restart/resume or manually lock views from
			the context menu.

		<p><strong>The Online Data settings in configuration have been updated to provide several new features:</strong></p>
		<p>You can now turn off Import when starting/resuming MediaPortal, this is of particular interest to 
			people experiencing performance issues or have slow/non-existant internet connections. To completely turn off
			automatic imports you also need to disable Updates.
		</p>
		<p>Downloading of user ratings can be disabled, when disabled the import will be faster but your episode ratings
			will not be synced with the online database.
		</p>
		<p>Downloading of missing artwork can be disabled, during import the plugin will check if any series or season has 
			no artwork available. If no artwork is found then an attempt will be done to check if any is available online and
			download them. Import will be faster when disabling, time difference is neglible on smaller databases.
		</p>
		<p>During import the plugin checks all series fanart and updates the local database with any missing or new fanarts.
			You can now disable this option for a faster import if you only want check for updates.
		</p>
		<p>You can now check for updates for episode(s) and series from Details tab in configuration. This will only do the updates
			on the selected item, it will not do a full import.
		</p>
		<p>Automatic download of Fanart that contain Series Names/Logos is now optional, this is turned off by default.</p>

		</ul>
		<p><strong>Note:</strong> there have been several updates (some of which are mentioned above) to the plugin which affect the skin, as a result all skins will need to be updated. See <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mptvseries/wiki/SkinDesignersGuide">Skin Designer's Guide</a> for more details on what
			has changed. Please don't raise any issues with out dated skins.
