		<ul>
			<li><p>Updated trakt.tv watched sync to do ALL episodes that have been scrobbled and or marked as seen online.</p></li>
      <li><p>Fixed (workaround) for actor images dissapearing when navigating the list. Also fixes flicker in Actors list layout.</p></li>
      <li><p>Fixed sorting of seasons when seasons numbering used 'Years'. Specials not sorted at end of season list in this case.</p></li>
      <li><p>Fixed sort order of Double Episodes in DVD Order.</p></li>
      <li><p>Fixed new series added not automatically downloading fanart under some conditions. Changed option for 'update all existing fanart on import' to disabled. Will always check for missing fanart on series now regardless of setting.</p></li>
      <li><p>Fixed sort order of episodes added to playlist when adding from the series view.</p></li>      
      <li><p>Added Episode Index label to playlist blue3wide skin so its easier to identify the selected episode.</p></li>

	</div>
	<div class="tab_content">
		<ul>
			<li><p>Added GUI to display Actor Names, Roles and Images for Series. Requires updated skin support and can be accessed from the context menu (F9/Info).</p></li>
      <li><p>Improved Artwork Downloading, you can configure how many series/season images are downloaded for each type from configuration. Also it will no longer download season images for every season if you dont have a reference to it in the database. Artwork limits will be ignored if a new artwork is higher rated that your existing collection, in this case it will download a new artwork.</p></li>
      <li><p>Fixed 'Download Blank Banners' not working, also added option for 'Download Text Banners' with both options off by default.</p></li>
			<li><p>Improved Replacement Rules, filenames containing roman numerals or Pt X of Y will be replaced with season/episode number equivalents.</p></li>
      <li><p>Watched items on trakt.tv will now be synced to your local collection. Note: this is only for the last 100 watched episodes, the API is being improved to better support syncing.</p></li>
			<li><p>Series/Episode ratings will now be sent to trakt.tv, ratings 7-10 are set to 'Ninja' and 1-6 as 'Weak Sauce'. Existing Ratings Sync is not yet implemented.</p></li>
			<li><p>Sending Ratings Online (theTVDB.com) is now done async so will not lock up the GUI anymore, this was particularly bad when the server was not available.</p></li>
      <li><p>Updated Default Parsing Expression to filter out files in sample directories and also fix files in root folder. Note: Click on reset in Parsing Expressions dialog to get update.</p></li>
      <li><p>When Episode image is not available or hidden, the currently selected Fanart will now be displayed instead.</p></li>
      <li><p>Episode Names and Series/Episode overviews will be auto populated if empty e.g Episode 1, "No overview currently available"</p></li>
      <li><p>Added option to add specials at the end of the season list rather than the beginning e.g. Season 1, Season 2, Specials. This is the new default and can be turned off from configuration.</p></li>
      <li><p>Fixed playlists not loading if duplicate or removed episodes were found.</p></li>
      <li><p>Fixed utf-8 encoding of xmls when downloading series details.</p></li>
      <li><p>Updated Spanish translations, thanks Oscar.</p></li>

		<ul>
			<li><p>Fixed trakt.tv manual synchronize from configuration not working after entering username/password. Needed to close and re-open for changes to take affect.</p></li>
			<li><p>Fixed series original name being cleared and looked up again after each update scan if not using English for Online Language.</p></li>
			<li><p>Fixed series original name not being set if there was no english translation online. This could result in error to find subtitles as series name would be empty. Also fixes the issue where online lookup would be done everytime Original name was required.</p></li>
			<li><p>Updated Subtitle Downloader library to v2.3.0.</p></li>

	<div class="tab_content">
		<ul>
			<li><p>Added Synchronization of your library including watched state to trakt.tv. Synchronization can be manually run from configuration or have the plugin handle this automatically in GUI. Toggling watched states from GUI will also be reflected online but you can only set something unwatched if it has not been scrobbled online. Removal of series/episode is not yet supported but is available via API.</p></li>
			<li><p>Added ability to map ACTION_PREV_PICTURE and ACTION_NEXT_PICTURE to remote control button or keyboard button. When action is recieved, it will cycle the series/season artwork. This is a shortcut to invoking the context menu and selecting Cycle Artwork.</p></li>
			<li><p>Fixed 'Mark All as Watched' option applying watched state to episodes that were in database but not visible on screen. Will now respect 'Show Local Files Only' setting, also will check that episode has aired, ignoring episodes with future air date.</p></li>			
			<li><p>Fixed theTVDB.com Series ID not being sent to trakt.tv when episode was scrobbled. This was a minor issue as we were sending correct original english title as well.</p></li>
			<li><p>Fixed trakt.tv play count not incrementing after 1st watch if episode did not play to 100%.</p></li>
			<li><p>Removed the trakt.tv user API key from configuration as it was un-needed, we can re-use the developer key.</p></li>

			<li><p>Issue 426: Added Find\Filter button to Parsing Wizard to execute filtering when ready rather than immediate filtering when typing.</p></li>
			<li><p>Issue 490: Retrieve online languages on a separate background thread when loading configuration so UI does not lockup.</p></li>
			<li><p>Issue N/A: Encode series name before doing lookup on API.</p></li>
			<li><p>Issue 494: Fixed 'User Rating Prompt' not being able to be disabled from GUI if no account id has been defined.</p></li>
			<li><p>Issue 493: Fixed case where files on mapped share that were added to database before 2.6.1 were not being removed when files no longer exist during local scan.</p></li>
			<li><p>Issue 333: Ability to UnHide episodes, seasons and series from GUI. Will use 'selectedColor' of skin list control property to identify hidden episodes. New Options menu item in GUI 'Show Hidden Items' will allow you to toggle hidden episodes from view, this property is shared with the one currently used in Configuration.</p></li>
			<li><p>Issue 214: In-line sorting of specials were still being shown in episode views when Season 0/Specials season was set to Hidden (This was because the individual episodes were not hidden as well). Setting a season to hidden/unhidden will now recursively set the property for each episode as well now. Users with current specials hidden and episodes not hidden will have to do a toggle manually to fix that up.</p></li>
			<li><p>Issue N/A: Added 'Ignore on Scan' option to context menu in the configuration details tab, removed from property grid. 'Ignore on Scan', stops updates on a particular series.</p></li>
			<li><p>Issue N/A: When setting series as Hidden, also set 'Ignore on Scan' on. When Un-Hiding series set 'Ignore on Scan' off.</p></li>
			<li><p>Issue 478: Episode Count for Season is not updated in season list facade when there is hidden episodes from view. Count will be based on what is seen like with 'Show Local Files' setting.</p></li>
			<li><p>Issue 492: Fixed online refresh actions being executed on series that have 'Ignore on Scan' property set.</p></li>
			<li><p>Issue 456: Fixed error appearing in log when browsing group views and no USEREDIT column exists in database.</p></li>
			<li><p>Issue 489: Added new view 'Available Media' which filters out any local episodes that are not available e.g. files on a disconnected network share or usb disk not plugged in.</p></li>
			<li><p>Issue 485: Fixed facade colour turning to remote colour when doing a local scan.</p></li>
			<li><p>Issue 488: Added 'Skip' to the Manual Series Lookup dialog. You could only press ESC or BACK previously which may not be obvious to user, having both entries 'Skip' and 'Skip / Never Ask Again' is much clearer.</p></li>
			<li><p>Issue N/A: Renamed 'Approved' to 'Approve' in series match dialog. Fixed small alignment issue in configuration->import tab.</p></li>
			<li><p>Issue 486: Updated Spanish Translation (thx joarreba!)</p></li>
			<li><p>Issue 483: Fixed manual import not being executed immediately when initial import is still delayed.</p></li>
			<li><p>Issue N/A: Some cleanup of the Debug logging.</p></li>
			<li><p>Issue N/A: Fix for last online scan log message being incorrectly reported.</p></li>
			<li><p>Issue N/A: Fixed retrieval of UserRatings being done on invalid series in database i.e. ID < 0.</p></li>
			<li><p>Issue 481: Automatically add required Parsing fields in Step 1 of Import Wizard 'Series Name', 'Season ID' and 'Episode ID'. Removed the Add Columns link when nothing supported to add plus minor UI changes.</p></li>			
			<li><p>Issue N/A: Added small delay (20 secs) before starting first File Scan when 'Scan remote shares is enabled', this will help for both CPU usage on start-up (which directly affects other plugin background tasks and also enough time for NICs to have initialised...this can help avoid a unnecessary Add Run).</p></li>
			<li><p>Issue 460: Really fixed SubCentral not being available to enable/disable from configuration if launched from Installer. Forgot to wrap the subcentral path in quotes before parsed to PluginConfigLoader.</p></li>
			<li><p>Issue 477: Fixed 'Insert Disk Message' not spanning multiple lines in Dialog.</p></li>
			<li><p>Issue 476: Fix unhandled exception when exiting back from Series Panel in Import Wizard if there was unfinished edits.</p></li>
			<li><p>Issue 475: Fixed rows in Step 1 of Import Wizard getting duplicated when adding a manual parse column.</p></li>
			<li><p>Issue N/A: Updated SubtitleDownloader.dll library to v2.2.0.</p></li>

		<div class="tab_img"></div>
	</div>
	<div class="tab_content">
		<p><strong>Improved Import Process in configuration</strong></p>
		<p>Importing in configuration has had a major overhaul, its now a wizard based process.</p>
		<p>Users can change the local file information before import begins in the wizard e.g. edit the episode number or season 
			number if tvseries does not recognise it.</p>
		<p>No more annoying popup dialogs awaiting series approval or episode order approval. This is now done as part of the wizard.</p>
		<p>Wizard also allows Local File to Online Episode Matching, e.g. Aired, DVD Order, Title matching or users
			can manually match an episode from the list.</p>
		<p>Improved feedback of Import Process, users can see a breakdown of the entire import procedure instead of a single progress bar.</p>
		<p>Improved Default Regular Expression, so now even more files are automatically recognized. Click Reset in 'Regular Expression' page in configuration if upgrading.</p>
		<p>Improved DVD Ordering such that it uses the Aired Order if DVD values are not set online.</p>
		<p>Forcing a new online match for a series online will now always prompt to choose series.</p>
		<p>Users can now change the 'Local File to Online Matching Method' for a series from the GUI in the Action Menu. 
			This allows your files to be rematched against different ordering such as DVD Order.</p>
		<p>Users can now sort the episode view by DVD Ordering or Aired Ordering.</p>
		<p>Note: Due to changes above, users whom already have episodes imported by DVD order need to delete these series from database and re-import.</p>

		<p>You can now edit a field in the database via the Details screen in configuration and have its data persist. i.e. it will 
			not be overwritten when an online update is run. For instance you can modify the Genres or a Series Title to your preference.</p>
		<p>Changes done to fields in database are highlighted with a different colour in configuration.</p>
		<p>To restore the default data for a field, simply delete the contents and it will automatically restore.</p>

			has changed. Please don't raise any issues with out dated skins.
